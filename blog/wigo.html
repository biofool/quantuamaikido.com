                    Surface and depth.<br>
                    What you see and what's actually happening.<br>
                    The difference determines everything.
                </div>

                <p>In Aikido, if you only respond to what you see—the fist, the grab, the apparent attack—you're already too late. By the time the physical movement happens, the real action is over. The attack formed in the mind, in the energy body, in the intention that precedes movement.</p>

                <p>A master doesn't respond to the technique. A master blends with the energy before it becomes technique.</p>

                <p>Same in conversation. Negotiation. Leadership. Life.</p>

                <p>Someone says one thing. Means another. Feels a third thing entirely. WIGO asks: what's actually going on here? Beneath the words, beneath the stated position, beneath the surface story—what's the real energy moving through this moment?</p>

                <h2>the practice</h2>

                <p>WIGO isn't passive observation. It's active inquiry. A practice of sensing deeper.</p>

                <p>Start with yourself.</p>

                <p>Someone cuts you off in traffic. You feel anger surge. Surface story: "That asshole cut me off."</p>

                <p>WIGO asks: what else is happening?</p>

                <p>Maybe you're already late. Already stressed. Already carrying tension from something that happened this morning. The driver didn't create your reactivity. They triggered it. The anger was waiting.</p>

                <p>WIGO reveals what's underneath—the compressed spring, the loaded pattern, the reactive pathway that fires automatically.</p>

                <p>Once you see that, you have choice.</p>

                <h2>quantum uncertainty</h2>

                <p>In quantum mechanics, particles exist in superposition—multiple possible states simultaneously—until observation collapses them into one state.</p>

                <p>In human experience, the same.</p>

                <p>Every situation carries multiple possible realities. How you observe it—the quality of your attention, your state of being, your openness or defensiveness—determines which possibility becomes actual.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>When you're angry, you see evidence confirming anger.<br>
                    When you're curious, you see nuance and complexity.<br>
                    When you're centered, you see opportunity where others see threat.</p>
                </div>

                <p>WIGO is the practice of recognizing that your observation isn't neutral. You're not discovering objective truth. You're participating in which reality emerges.</p>

                <h2>the cyprus example</h2>

                <p>Summer 1995. Greek and Turkish Cypriots in the same room for the first time in years.</p>

                <p>Surface conflict: territory, history, justice, identity. Decades of grievance. Clear positions. No room for compromise.</p>

                <p>WIGO revealed something else.</p>

                <p>Beneath every position: fear.<br>
                Fear of losing home, culture, safety, future.<br>
                Fear that acknowledging the other's pain invalidates your own.<br>
                Fear that peace means betrayal of those who suffered.</p>

                <p>Once we could name the fear—not as weakness but as what's actually going on—the conversation changed. Not because fear disappeared. Because it could be included. Acknowledged. Worked with.</p>

                <p>You can't negotiate fear away. But you can transform it once you recognize it's there.</p>

                <h2>the levels</h2>

                <p>WIGO operates at multiple depths:</p>

                <div class="levels-list">
                    <h4>Physical Level</h4>
                    <p>Body language. Tension. Breath. What the soma reveals that words hide.</p>

                    <h4>Emotional Level</h4>
                    <p>Affect. Mood. The feeling underneath the feeling. Anger protecting hurt. Criticism masking fear. Withdrawal defending against vulnerability.</p>

                    <h4>Cognitive Level</h4>
                    <p>The story being told. The story being lived. The gap between them. What's being said vs. what's being meant.</p>

                    <h4>Energetic Level</h4>
                    <p>The field itself. The quality of space between people. Whether energy flows or stagnates. Whether presence invites or repels.</p>

                    <h4>Systemic Level</h4>
                    <p>Patterns repeating across time. Cultural conditioning. Historical trauma. The weight of everything that came before this moment.</p>
                </div>

                <p>All of it happening simultaneously.<br>
                All of it influencing what becomes possible.</p>

                <h2>practice: the pause</h2>

                <p>You can't see clearly while reacting.</p>

                <p>WIGO requires the Quantum Pause—space between stimulus and response where perception can deepen.</p>

                <p>Someone says something triggering. Before you respond:</p>

                <div class="practice-box">
                    <h3>The WIGO Practice</h3>
                    <p><strong>Pause. Breathe. Feel.</strong><br>
                    Notice the surge of energy in your body. Don't suppress it. Don't act on it. Feel it.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ask: What else is here?</strong><br>
                    Not just in them. In you. What got activated? What pattern fired? What fear or need or old wound started speaking?</p>

                    <p><strong>Inquire: What might be true that I'm not seeing?</strong><br>
                    Not "what's really true"—you don't know yet. But what other possibilities exist? What might this person be experiencing that would make their behavior make sense?</p>

                    <p><strong>Respond from center, not reactivity.</strong><br>
                    Once you've felt more, seen more, recognized more, then act. Your response will be different. More precise. More effective. More human.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>the swimming pool</h2>

                <p>1997. Electronic coaching via voicemail.</p>

                <p>I used to tell executives: "Imagine a swimming pool. At the bottom, there's a message. To get the message, you have to dive down. You'll feel pressure. You'll need to hold your breath. You'll want to come up for air. But the wisdom is at the bottom. Not at the surface."</p>

                <p>WIGO is the dive.</p>

                <p>Surface level gives you positions, statements, the apparent conflict.<br>
                Five feet down, you find emotions.<br>
                Ten feet down, you find needs.<br>
                Fifteen feet down, you find fears.<br>
                Twenty feet down, you find the core—what this is really about.</p>

                <p>Most conflict resolution works at the surface. Negotiating positions. Finding compromise. Splitting the difference.</p>

                <p>WIGO goes deep. To the place where positions dissolve into something more fundamental. Where you discover that you and your "opponent" both want safety, dignity, recognition, connection—just different strategies for getting there.</p>

                <p>At that depth, transformation becomes possible.</p>

                <h2>not analysis</h2>

                <p>WIGO isn't intellectual analysis.<br>
                It's not figuring out. Not solving. Not diagnosing.</p>

                <p>It's sensing. Feeling. Intuiting.</p>

                <p>The information comes through the body first. Through somatic awareness. Through that subtle knowing that arrives before thought can explain it.</p>

                <p>You walk into a room and sense tension even though everyone's smiling.<br>
                You talk with someone who's saying yes but you feel no.<br>
                You sense an opening in a conversation before you can articulate why.</p>

                <p>That's WIGO in action.</p>

                <p>The practice develops this sensitivity. Not by thinking harder. By feeling more accurately. By trusting the intelligence that moves through you when you're present enough to receive it.</p>

                <h2>try this</h2>

                <p>Next difficult conversation you're in—or next time you're triggered—try this:</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>Don't try to fix it. Don't try to win. Don't even try to be right.<br><br>
                    Just ask: What's really going on here?</p>
                </div>

                <p>Get curious about your own reactivity.<br>
                Get curious about what the other person might be experiencing.<br>
                Get curious about the field between you.</p>

                <p>See what changes when you shift from defending to exploring.<br>
                See what becomes possible when you're interested in truth more than being right.</p>

                <p>WIGO doesn't solve problems.<br>
                It reveals what's actually happening so intelligence can respond appropriately.</p>

                <p>Sometimes what's needed is boundary.<br>
                Sometimes it's compassion.<br>
                Sometimes it's fierce clarity.<br>
                Sometimes it's silence.</p>

                <p>You won't know until you see what's really going on.</p>

                <h2>the deeper practice</h2>

                <p>Eventually, WIGO becomes a way of being.</p>

                <p>Not something you do. Something you are.</p>

                <p>You walk through the world seeing multiple layers simultaneously. Surface and depth. Apparent and actual. Story and energy.</p>

                <p>Not because you're analyzing. Because you're present. Because you've practiced feeling into what's beneath appearance for so long that it becomes natural.</p>

                <p>That's mastery.</p>
